# This config file contains variables the user can modify through option "-C" configuration filename. 
# To see all variable names and their current values run "jamu -f" from the command line.
# Once you make changes, verify those changes by running "jamu -f" again.
# This file is an example, copy and rename (e.g. jamu.conf) so that the next distribution does
# not clobber your personal settings.
# You can have multiple configuration files with different names that have settings for specific tasks.

# START  variables section---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# All variables a user can modify are listed below with their default values. To change a variable
# remove the leading '#' and change the value (after the ':'). Limited editing of the values is 
# performed so be careful. Without caution you can certainly cause jamu to fail/abort.
# NOTE: Do not surround any value data with quotes even if it contains spaces.
#       e.g. the directory name "/home/my dir/my posters" is expressed as value /home/my dir/my posters

#####
# PURPOSE: Override series/movie names to reduce the need for manual interaction

#
# FORMAT:
# Any line starting with "#" is treated as a comment
# Any blank line is ignored
# All other lines must have two fields in this specific order:
# 1st) The series/movie name or the %TITLE% field as passed by MythTV and a trailing ':' character
# 2nd) The thetvdb.com series id (SID) or themoviedb.com imdb number as specified for the 
#       series/movie on thetvdb.com or themoviedb.com wiki. This will override the series/movie 
#       name to eliminate the need for manual interaction.  
# NOTE: Included here, but disabled are examples of current (2009) TV shows that Schedule Direct
#       has different TV series names then what is on thetvdb.com wiki. If you are searching for 
#       series based on the Schedule Direct names as MythTV does then the wrong TV series will be
#       identified. You can pick the correct series by using interactive mode but this does not 
#       help with unattended processing. This section allows you to specify the correct TV series
#       on thetvbd.com despite the name in Schedule Direct. Luckily there are not many TV series
#       That require overrides.
#       The only time themoviedb.com is referenced is when the (-M) option is used and a 
#       video files name does not having season and episode numbers. Those video files are
#       assumed to be movies.

# START Secondary sources section--------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: This section is only active in conjunction with the Mythmetadata (-M) option
# Purpose:
# The primary sources of graphics and meta data for Tv Series and Movies are thetvdb.com and 
# themoviedb.com respectively. Sometimes these sources do not have the requested metadata or graphics.
# This section allows you to add secondary sources when the primary come up empty.
# Secondary source requirements:
# 1) A secondary source must have a command line interface such as "fetch_poster.py". 
# 2) The format of the returned values (through stdout) must match that of the existing grabber
#    scripts such as tmdb.pl and ttvdb.py.
# 3) You must specify the fully qualified name of the secondary source (path and filename)
# 4) You must specify the command line switches that the secondary source requires to get specific data
# 5) You must specify the dynamic data required by the secondary sources. Dynamic data is from a 
#    restricted set specified below.
#
# NOTE: The secondary source for meta data (textual data) is used as an attempt to fill in missing
#       data for a video file. The primary source and the secondary source data is combined
#       to complete as much information as is available between the two sources. The primary 
#       source always takes precedence.
#
# Dynamic data:
# %%(inetref)s      - This can be a thetvdb.com series id, TMDB number, IMDB ...etc. This is equal to 
#                     the mythdb table 'videometadata' field 'inetref'.
# %%(imdb)s         - Specifies an IMDB number whether or not the inetref is already an IMDB number. 
#                     This variable is required as in most cases the inetref will be a TMDB number but
#                     most secondary sources still require an IMDB number. NOTE: Despite the source
#                     of the graphics files the naming convention is always "inetref.ext"
# %%(name)s         - This can be a TV series name or movie name.
# %%(subtitle)s     - This is usually a TV series episode name
# %%(season)d       - This is a TV series season number
# %%(episode)d      - This is a TV series episode number
# %%(filename)s     - This is the video file name as found on your computer
# %%(fullfilename)s - This is the fully qualified video path and filename (mainly for user scripts) 
#
# The secondary sources are split into a movie section and a TV series section.
# Tv series are defined as any video file names that contain season and episode numbers.
# The type of data is specified by the key value. 
# Valid keys are:
# poster   - This is also know as a cover art or a cover image
# fanart
# banner   - At this time only TV series have banners. FYI - tmdb.pl refers to fanart as a banner.
#            If you add a 'banner' key to the movie section it will be ignored.
# metadate - The video file's text description e.g. plot, director ... etc
