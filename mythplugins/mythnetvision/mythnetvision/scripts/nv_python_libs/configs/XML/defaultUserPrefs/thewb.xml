        "globalmax" (optional) Is a way to limit the number of items processed per RSS feed for all
                    treeview URLs. A value of zero (0) means there are no limitations.
        "enabled" If you want to remove a RSS feed then change the "enabled" attribute to "false". Do not
                  delete the element.
        "max" (optional)  Is a way to limit the number of items processed for an individual RSS feed.
              This value will override any "globalmax" setting. A value of zero (0) means
              there are no limitations and would be the same if the attribute was no included at all.
